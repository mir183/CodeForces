## About Codeforces

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is a popular competitive programming platform that hosts contests and provides a vast collection of coding problems. It's a great place to improve your algorithmic and coding skills.

## Solutions

I organize my solutions by contest and problem name in this repository. You can find my solutions in the directory. Each solution is named according to the problem's code on Codeforces.


## Contributing

Happy coding!
